## Description

This defines three ruby text objects â€“ block, class and function.
A block is delimited by the regex in the variable `g:ruby_block_openers` and
`end`.
A function is a special case of block, starting with `def`, class works the
same way.
The inner variant doesn't include the delimiter lines.

## Usage

By default, the omaps `ir` and `ar` are used for a block; `if` and `af` for a
function, `ic` and `ac` for a class.

## Customization

The variable `g:textobj_ruby_inclusive` controls whether leading comments and a
single blank line are included in the `a` object if present, defaulting to 1.

Consult the documentation of [textobj-user][1] for custom mappings.

## Details

The plugin uses a consistent line based approach, with the lines containing the
delimiters being part of the block.
This means that when invoking the text object on the word before a `do` will
select the block opened by it, which is especially useful on empty blocks.
When the `ir` object is used on the opener line, the selection will begin on
the next line.

The reason for inclusive mode is that when deleting or copying a function, you
most likely want to paste it somewhere else and not leave an additional empty
line around (given that you separate all functions by a single blank line).
Comments directly above a block are most likely connected to it, so leaving
them would be impractical.
